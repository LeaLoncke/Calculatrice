#CALCULATOR

It's a project for my training, the object is to make a calculator.

There are two versions: a simple calculator or a complicated calculator.

The simple version:  
- the entire operation is displayed on the screen  
- when we click on the equal button, the result is displayed  
- we can delete elements in the operation  

The complicated version:   
- the operation is not displayed as a whole on the screen  
- the current result of the operation is displayed on the screen when you click on an operator  

For the moment, I did the simple version.
